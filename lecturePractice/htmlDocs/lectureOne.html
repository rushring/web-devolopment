        <h1> Data representation </h1>
        <p>
            A computer represents a piece of data with a specific number of bits, which can be a <i>number</i>, a <i>character</i>, 
            an <i>image</i>, a <i>sound</i>, a <i>video</i>, etc. A computer's internal data representation method is called data 
            representation. Let's look at how different forms of data can be stored in computer memory.
             The methods used to represent information in computers are known as data representation. 
             The computer system can store a variety of data types.
        </p>

        <p>  
            <b>Numeric data</b>, <b>text</b>, <b>executable files</b>, <b>pictures</b>, <b>audio</b>, and <b>video</b>
             are all examples of computer data representation. To us, as humans, each of these will appear differently.
